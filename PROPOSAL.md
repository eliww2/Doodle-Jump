# Project Proposal

For my project I will be remaking the popular Iphone platform game DoodleJump.
I will be using Cinder to help implement/play this game and probably some additional external libraries.

## Details:

My game will have a character that starts on the bottom and starts with an initial velocity.
He will start falling and must keep hopping on each randomly placed platform to keep from falling off the screen.
There will be no winning, however a highscore will be kept track of.

## Background:

I have little background in game development, however I am familiar with Cinder for graphics 
and have a strong background in physics I will use for the game engine.

##Timeline:

This will be a 3 week project and here is the goals I would like to accomplish each week.

####Week 1:

Implement character and platforms that randomly spawn a specified amount. 
Add acceleration and velocity to character.

####Week 2:

Implement physics engine and collision logic for the platforms and character.
Add a score keeper and a highscore keeper.

####Week 3:

Add better graphics such as background, character skin, and platform skin.
Potentially add platforms that can only be used once.

##Extra:

If I have extra time/ finish early then I plan on adding extra items
to the game such as boosts or platforms/characters to avoid.
