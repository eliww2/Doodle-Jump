keep a highscore. 

## Background: 

In the game you have you character who will jump from platform
to platform to get as high as possible. These platforms randomly spawn
so to keep the player on their feet. To play you must move left in right to
insure you land on a platform and don't fall to your death.


## Controls:

There are 3 Controls in the game in total.

ARROW RIGHT: This moves you're character to the right and increases the velocity to the right.

##Additional:

If you move your character off the screen on the left or right, 
then he will "wrap around" or come back on the other side of your screen.
